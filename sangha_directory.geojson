        "description": "We are a sangha in the Plum Village tradition, our teacher is Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk Thich Naht Hanh (Thay) who passed away in January 2022. Thich Naht Hanh is one of the most prominent spiritual teachers of the 20th century. He was a peace activist, poet, author and most importantly a sangha builder. His teachings about mindfulness are unsurpassed. Lotus Bud Sangha was established by our dear Vietnamese dharma teachers in the 1980s who wanted to share this practice with the Vietnamese community and the wider Australian community. From those small but powerful beginnings we have a number of lay sanghas in Sydney and now our own meditation centre Mountain Spring Monastery at Bilpin.We would love to have you practice with us. What is practicing you may ask? In our sangha (community of meditators) we practice sitting and walking meditation, learn about the dharma (Buddhist teachings) and share about our experiences on the path of practice. We welcome beginners and experienced meditators as we learn from each other wherever we are in our practice. The group of regular facilitators at Lotus Buds are experienced meditators in the Plum Village tradition. We have been taught and guided by dharma teacher John Barclay who received the lamp transmission from Thich Nhat Hanh. John has been leading the sangha for many years, by teaching the dharma and mentoring many of us. He is also a Buddhist scripture teacher to primary and secondary students in Sydney. Meditation can be challenging at times however being in a sangha supports our practice and makes it easier. Being in a sangha with friends with shared values and a shared practice brings us joy and gives us energy. With weekly practice and spiritual friendships the path becomes easier and more beautiful.Each Wednesday we practice sitting and walking mediation, recite trainings, or explore a teaching and share our reflections. Most importantly we learn about how meditation and the Plum Village practices can help us in our daily lives. Thich Nhat Hanh’s teachings help us to transform our suffering so we can become more peaceful and happy. Wherever you may be in your meditation practice you are welcome to join us."

Dabei sind wir zum Einen von der Plum Village-Tradition des buddhistischen Lehrers Thich Nhat Hanh inspiriert. Hier legen wir großen Wert auf Geh-Meditation. Zum Anderen praktizieren wir auch Wege von naturverbundener weiblicher Spiritualität, zum Beispiel inspiriert von Chameli Gad Ardagh (“Awakening Women”). Die Praxis wechselt sich ab:2 x Monat: Praxis nach Thich Nhat Hanh2 x Monat: Praxis in weiblicher Spiritualität oder lange Gehmeditation draußenOrganisatorisches: WANN | Wir treffen uns immer mittwochs ab ca. 19:00/19:30 und praktizieren ca. bis 21:00/21:30 Uhr gemeinsam.WO | Wir treffen uns in Privatwohnungen in Kahl. Bei schönem Wetter möchten wir in Zukunft auch den kompletten Abend draußen praktizieren. Die Gehmeditation führer wir immer draußen durch: geeignete Kleidung und Schuhe helfen daher.Praxismethoden: In der Plum Village-Tradition: Zu unseren Praxismethoden gehören Sitzmeditation (geleitet bzw. still), Gehmeditation; ergänzend ist z. B. Essmeditation möglichWeibliche Spiritualität: z. B. Yoga-Übungen; z. B. visuelle Reisen; z. B. Trommeln, singen oder tönen; z. B. Naturerlebnisse im Wald etc. Nicht bei jeden unserer Sangha-Abende muss es also eine “klassische” Meditation geben. Es gibt aber bei jedem Treffen eine spirituelle Praxis sowie einen Austausch (Dharma Sharing).Lehrer*innen / Inspirationen: Wir orientieren uns zum Einen an der Achtsamkeitspraxis und dem “Engagierten Buddhismus”, den Thich Nhat Hanh geprägt hat; zum Anderen an Chameli Gad Ardagh (“Awakening Women”)Wir freuen uns über weitere weibliche Mitglieder, die gemeinsam mit uns Achtsamkeit praktizieren und für die spirituellen Richtungen, die wir einschlagen, offen sind.Kontakt: Interessentinnen melden sich bitte am besten per E-Mail an MelaniePrengel@posteo.debeispielhafter Ablauf der Abende in der Plum Village Tradition:- 19:00 Uhr * Ankommen und “Check-in” (innerer Wetterbericht)- 19:10 Uhr * Gehmeditation draußen (z.

During these evenings we regularly drink tea together and sing songs accompanied by guitar. Our group welcomes practitioners of all traditions and experience levels to practice mindfulness in comunity. It is necessary that you speak at least a basic level of German.Currently, we are a stable group of 5-6 people ranging from anywhere between 25 and above 40 years of age. However, because we move to a new and bigger room this summer, we are in the process of raising awareness of our sangha, so that we can practice with even more friends. The new room will be only a few minutes from our current room and more towards the direction of Münster's city centre."

At every session we practise sitting and walking meditation, we read out a fragment of Thay's books and we have a Dharma sharing about our being both queer and Dharma practicioners, cultivating deep listening and loving speech. We meet every 2nd and 4th Friday of the month. We regularly organise mindful days and special thematic meetings to deepen our practise. As we are the only sangha designed for LGBTQIA+ in Italy, we also offer our siblings from outside Florence to attend our sessions online."

Några av oss har varit med länge och troget - andra kommer och går, utifrån behov och intresse. Bland oss finns både personer som har en stark personlig relation till just den här buddhistiska traditionen, och personer som har sina andliga rötter i andra sammanhang. Du måste inte vara eller bli buddhist för att praktisera med oss - det viktiga är att du har ett intresse av att ta del av traditionens meditationspraktik med ett öppet hjärta och sinne."

        "description": "“So with a boundless heart one should cherish all living beings, suffusing the whole world with unobstructed loving-kindness”The Boundless Heart Sangha meets every Monday online starting at 7.00pm and is led by Sangha members. We begin with a personal and practice check-in, which enables the establishment of a warm community at the start of the session. We move to a period of sitting meditation, sometimes silent and sometimes guided. This is followed by a reading most commonly from one of Thay’s books, chosen by a Sangha member. On the first Monday of each month, this is replaced by the reciting of the five mindfulness trainings. We end with a period of ‘Dharma sharing’ where we share from the heart, and practise deep listening, or silent contemplation, finishing around 8.15pm .Sangha is rooted in the teachings of the Buddha and we welcome people from any, or no, faith background. Whatever our beliefs, we come together in the spirit of compassion and a desire to live fully and completely in every moment of our lives. Mindfulness means ‘keeping the conscious alive to the present reality’. We practise mindfulness in order to come back to what is happening in the present moment in our daily lives which allows us to slow our lives down; touch the healing elements that touch the boundless heart inside us and around us, and to nourish the seeds of joy, peace, compassion, and understanding in ourselves and others. Mindfulness supports us to live freely and to face everyday challenges with more balance and poise.We would love you to join us in our meditation practice.

        "description": "Our Sangha was founded in 2001 by 6 members who had just been to Plum Village, the monastic community in France where Vietnamese Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh (or “Thay”) is based. (“Thay” means “Teacher” in Vietnamese)We meet (in-person and on Zoom) every Thursday evening 6.30-7.30. We are funded by donations quarterly or £2 on the night. In summer we meet at Barham Church Hall, Church Road, Barham, IP6 0PT , and in winter in each others’ homes. After a few minutes discussing business, the evening starts with a guided meditation, led in turn by the members, followed by a Tea Ceremony and a Dharma sharing. In the Dharma sharing we benefit from each other’s insights and experience of the practice. We listen deeply while members share their experiences, and refrain from giving advice. Whatever is shared is confidential.A small Dharma Study group meets every 1 or 2 months, at a member’s home, to watch a DVD of a talk by Thay.We hold a Morning of Mindfulness every 2nd Saturday of the month, 10am-1.00pm. This includes walking meditation, sitting meditation and other activities such as Touching the Earth, watching a video of Thay, Dharma sharing, etc. We all bring food and drink to share. For several years, we have organised an annual weekend retreat, in a hired centre.Any surplus donations are shared between Thay’s charities in Vietnam and the Community of Interbeing’s Practice Centre Project and Bursary Fund.Contact Isabelle for venues (isabellewen@hotmail.com or (01473)422155Our Mindfulness PracticeOur Sangha practises the art of mindfulness. Our breath is an essential element in our practice of mindfulness. It is always with us and unites our body and mind. The sound of the bell is also a central feature as it reminds us to come back to our breath and dwell in the present moment.Sitting meditation – There are many different postures recommended for sitting meditation. Thay recommends that we adopt a position where we feel comfortable and alert. This maybe cross-legged on a cushion, legs tucked underneath a stool or sitting upright on an ordinary chair. The breath should be deep and light. Our back should be straight. Our hands resting lightly in our lap or our knees. Our eyes can be lightly open or closed, and our mouth ideally in a gentle smile.The period of meditation begins with 3 sounds of the bell and is brought to a close with 3 sounds of the bell.Walking Meditation – When we practise walking meditation the breath is co-ordinated with our steps. When we hear the bell to start we take an in-breath and make one step with the left foot. On the out breath we take another step with the right foot. Then the cycle begins again. Throughout we are continually aware of the body.Recommended reading – “The Blooming of the Lotus”, “The Miracle of Mindfulness”, both by Thich Nhat Hanh."

Instead, sangha members take turns facilitating the sangha meetings, using practices we have learned at retreats with Thay and the monastics. We have found that the support of a sangha is essential for our practice, and we welcome anyone who is looking for a group in this tradition. We named our sangha in 2003 for where we were when we started, and we also know that lotuses are in muddy water, and muddy water is in lotuses."

The general Sangha format starts with both children and adults signing practice songs, followed by group walking meditation, then a short guided meditation from the Plum Village app. Then the children separate for their own program while the adults practice silent sitting meditation, followed by a Dharma offering and ending with a focus on Dharma Sharing. Dharma Offerings are: 1st Sunday - 5 MT recitation, 2nd Sunday - Chanting or Touching the Earth, 3rd Sunday - Children's Program for all, 4th Sunday - Discourse Reading, 5th Sunday - Deep Relaxation."

We are a growing group of mindfulness practitioners who practice sitting meditation daily in Santa Monica, CA on the beach at Lifeguard Station 22. Dress warm & bring a beach towel or blanket for sitting. We suggest using the Sundial app to pick the ideal time when you want to come sit. Individuals typically sit for 1 to 2 hours at their own comfort and convenience. Practitioners can meet and socialize after the sitting meditation and we may try to coordinate mindful walking and compassionate listening sessions if there is interest. We can discuss our favorite Thich Nhat Hanh books, or how we got started meditating. We would like to suggest that everyone reads some of Thich Nhat Hanh's books (over 30 in english) and that they also download and check out the Plum Village App as a resource. As we all become better practitioners, we'll be able to help each other more. This is really a community run initiative, we're hoping to get it started, but we have no formal leadership structure. This is all about what works for each person, giving us a chance to meet others with similar practices and giving us the opportunity to grow a community (Sangha)."

This is followed by a discussion to clarify the day's topic, relate it to the full discourse as a whole and how it supports our daily mindful practice.  We transition this knowledge with intent upon experiencing the topic through meditation.  Lastly, we have dharma sharing about our meditative experience and new awareness.\n"

We also pursue and choose practices supported by the best available scientific evidence.Plum Village practices that we currently regularly engage in several times per week to daily: morning sitting meditation, Dharma sharing, reading of books by Thich Nhat Hanh AND twice monthly: beginning anew.

Our root monastery is Magnolia Grove in Batesville MS. We are the practice center for PVT in the St. Louis MO area but our reach online has extended across the Midwest, even across the US. Midwest Moon Sangha is inclusive and welcoming to all traditions so long as they are healthy and wholesome, but our practice is certainly Plum Village. We offer online dharma talks as well. We have spun off two other communities in cose fellowship with our sangha: Rooted River Wake Up Sangha which meets 7pm on Wednesdays online; and a community in Carbondale IL as well as a budding group mid-Missouri Please join us!"
