        "description": "We are a sangha in the Plum Village tradition, our teacher is Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk Thich Naht Hanh (Thay) who passed away in January 2022. Thich Naht Hanh is one of the most prominent spiritual teachers of the 20th century. He was a peace activist, poet, author and most importantly a sangha builder. His teachings about mindfulness are unsurpassed. Lotus Bud Sangha was established by our dear Vietnamese dharma teachers in the 1980s who wanted to share this practice with the Vietnamese community and the wider Australian community. From those small but powerful beginnings we have a number of lay sanghas in Sydney and now our own meditation centre Mountain Spring Monastery at Bilpin.We would love to have you practice with us. What is practicing you may ask? In our sangha (community of meditators) we practice sitting and walking meditation, learn about the dharma (Buddhist teachings) and share about our experiences on the path of practice. We welcome beginners and experienced meditators as we learn from each other wherever we are in our practice. The group of regular facilitators at Lotus Buds are experienced meditators in the Plum Village tradition. We have been taught and guided by dharma teacher John Barclay who received the lamp transmission from Thich Nhat Hanh. John has been leading the sangha for many years, by teaching the dharma and mentoring many of us. He is also a Buddhist scripture teacher to primary and secondary students in Sydney. Meditation can be challenging at times however being in a sangha supports our practice and makes it easier. Being in a sangha with friends with shared values and a shared practice brings us joy and gives us energy. With weekly practice and spiritual friendships the path becomes easier and more beautiful.Each Wednesday we practice sitting and walking mediation, recite trainings, or explore a teaching and share our reflections. Most importantly we learn about how meditation and the Plum Village practices can help us in our daily lives. Thich Nhat Hanh’s teachings help us to transform our suffering so we can become more peaceful and happy. Wherever you may be in your meditation practice you are welcome to join us.",

We meet in a high quality hybrid format, with some people attending in person and some people attending by Zoom. Beginners, long time practitioners, and people who have never meditated but think they might like to explore a Buddhist practice are invited to join us. Our Sangha began practicing in 2004. We base our practices upon the Thich Nhat Hanh tradition. We start with a check-in, 20-minute silent sitting meditation and 10 minutes of walking meditation, followed by 30 minutes of dharma study. We may have another short silent sitting meditation and then our closing. During our Dharma time we study together from a common book, with occasional articles of interest or discussions of our individual practices. These include Thich Nhat Hanh and many other teachers’ works. We also sometimes participate in retreats or special events in the area. Everyone is welcome!",

We are only meeting online currently but I hope to have a physical space where we can practice in person. I am hoping to build a community steeped in the Plum Village tradition and growing an OI team to support many local in person people, but also offering our current virtual meetings either as a hybrid meeting or separate way to reach remote connections seeking a solid community focused on mindful living and engaged buddhism.\nWe currently are doing book studies (currently We Were Made For These Times book) and basic sitting meditation. My goal is to build a regular weekly practice of Sitting, Walking, Silent meditation, followed by a Dharma Talk (using books, articles, or videos by Thay and others) to offer a deeper lesson then community discussion time to share. I'd like to offer tea in our discussion time.\nAs we grow I would like to start having Quarterly Days of Mindfulness. I would eventually like to build an annual retreat for the DFW community as we do not have anything like this locally yet. I will be leaning on OI and Dharma Teachers when we get to that stage but right now it is only myself facilitating.",

We welcome everyone from the Guildford area, across Surrey and further afield to join our meetings for regular practice together.

        "description": "Our Sangha was founded in 2001 by 6 members who had just been to Plum Village, the monastic community in France where Vietnamese Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh (or “Thay”) is based. (“Thay” means “Teacher” in Vietnamese)We meet (in-person and on Zoom) every Thursday evening 6.30-7.30. We are funded by donations quarterly or £2 on the night. In summer we meet at Barham Church Hall, Church Road, Barham, IP6 0PT , and in winter in each others’ homes. After a few minutes discussing business, the evening starts with a guided meditation, led in turn by the members, followed by a Tea Ceremony and a Dharma sharing. In the Dharma sharing we benefit from each other’s insights and experience of the practice. We listen deeply while members share their experiences, and refrain from giving advice. Whatever is shared is confidential.A small Dharma Study group meets every 1 or 2 months, at a member’s home, to watch a DVD of a talk by Thay.We hold a Morning of Mindfulness every 2nd Saturday of the month, 10am-1.00pm. This includes walking meditation, sitting meditation and other activities such as Touching the Earth, watching a video of Thay, Dharma sharing, etc. We all bring food and drink to share. For several years, we have organised an annual weekend retreat, in a hired centre.Any surplus donations are shared between Thay’s charities in Vietnam and the Community of Interbeing’s Practice Centre Project and Bursary Fund.Contact Isabelle for venues (isabellewen@hotmail.com or (01473)422155Our Mindfulness PracticeOur Sangha practises the art of mindfulness. Our breath is an essential element in our practice of mindfulness. It is always with us and unites our body and mind. The sound of the bell is also a central feature as it reminds us to come back to our breath and dwell in the present moment.Sitting meditation – There are many different postures recommended for sitting meditation. Thay recommends that we adopt a position where we feel comfortable and alert. This maybe cross-legged on a cushion, legs tucked underneath a stool or sitting upright on an ordinary chair. The breath should be deep and light. Our back should be straight. Our hands resting lightly in our lap or our knees. Our eyes can be lightly open or closed, and our mouth ideally in a gentle smile.The period of meditation begins with 3 sounds of the bell and is brought to a close with 3 sounds of the bell.Walking Meditation – When we practise walking meditation the breath is co-ordinated with our steps. When we hear the bell to start we take an in-breath and make one step with the left foot. On the out breath we take another step with the right foot. Then the cycle begins again. Throughout we are continually aware of the body.Recommended reading – “The Blooming of the Lotus”, “The Miracle of Mindfulness”, both by Thich Nhat Hanh.",

Links to the practices provided by Plum Village UK can be found here: https://plumvillage.uk/Our weekly calendar looks like this:MONDAY MORNINGS: “FROM THE HEART” 08.30Offered via Facebook Live, the “From The Heart” sessions are a time where Andy shares a brief reading from Thay’s books, starting and closing with a brief meditation. From the Heart can be accessed from this page. Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/558068675090521WEDNESDAY SANGHA SITTING, 18.30 – 20.00Our Wednesday night Sangha Sitting is provided via Zoom. We sit and share some of Thay’s teachings, such as working through a book together. We then meditate on what we have heard and enjoy a time of dharma sharing at the end. The link for these sessions is posted on the Singing Bowl Sangha page, usually the day before the sitting.Attending these practices does not tie you into anything, there are no conditions, expectations, obligations, or requirements and, best of all, there’s no fee! They are simply offered to support us all to progress in our path.Welcome! With a smile, Andy",
